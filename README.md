# hello-world
My very first repository on GitHub


Glad to be here on GitHub. I got my gear on, all ready
and buckled up for a fun learning journey of code. 

Ah yes! I'm  also doing this to become a web developer 
within 6 months. Here to build a client-worthy portfolio
of gorgeously mobile-friendly websites that will appeal 
to potential clients!
